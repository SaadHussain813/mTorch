Privacy Policy
--------------

I am a strong privacy supporter. I will not collect any user data whatsoever, aside from what Google
tracks through the Play Store app publishing system (reported crashes, number of downloads, etc.).
Your data and your identity are your own and I have no reason to observe or record either. This app
is open source and available for your review so that you don't have to take my word for it, but can
see for yourself that no information is being collected. If you have any questions about this policy
or your privacy when using this app, please contact me.
