            <h1>mTorch</h1>
            <p>mTorch is a minimalistic torch/flashlight app for Android. It is objectively and measurably superior to every other app ever created for any platform in the history of computing. Period. It is technologically impossible for a better app to exist, and that's a proven fact. It's science. The previous statements are entirely false, except for the first sentence.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">THE Solution</h2>
                <p>Bumping around in the dark is dangerous and I can never find a flashlight when I need one (partially because it's dark and hard to see), but I <em>always</em> have my mobile phone with me. Eureka! Wouldn't it be great if my phone could double as a flashlight?! Immediately, I went to the Play Store and searched for a flashlight/torch app. Nothing. Surely I must be searching incorrectly, there must be one out there somewhere. Nada. And thus, the idea for this app was born. Since nobody else had done it, I felt compelled to create such an app myself and provide a greatly needed service to those in desperate need of light.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <h2 class="text-primary">Functional</h2>
                <p>While other developers scurry to implement the latest and greatest fad in their apps, I focus on sound mechanics and doing what needs to be done. What can this app do that others can't, you might ask? Allow me to illuminate. This app doesn't only look great while taking up minimal system resources, but when you touch the lamp graphic - it actually turns the flashlight on your device ON. Impressive? Perhaps. But you deserve the very best, and that's why I dedicated my time and energy to making sure this was feature number one. It turns on, and it turns on well. Amazing, but not enough? No problem. In addition to turning the light on, touching the lamp graphic again will also toggle the light OFF. Yup, I went there. And the best part about these great features? 60% of the time, they work every time.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Lean</h2>
                <p>This app was designed with the minimalist in mind. Other developers try to add "neat" features and "cool" tweaks to make their app stand out above the rest - but not me. It is my solemn promise to you as a developer to keep the features to a bare minimum. There will be no extraneous benefits in my app whatsoever. Strobe Mode? Squashed! Flashy colors on the screen? Eliminated! Widgets? Eradicated! I will strive to keep this app nearly feature-free and borderline useless for as long as I maintain it.</p>

                <p>I am a strong privacy supporter. I will not collect any user data whatsoever, aside from what Google tracks through the Play Store app publishing system (reported crashes, number of downloads, etc.). Your data and your identity are your own and I have no reason to observe or record either. This app is open source and <a href="https://github.com/wKovacs64/mTorch">available</a> for your review so that you don't have to take my word for it, but can see for yourself that no information is being collected.

                <p>This app doesn't have a ton of strings, but I would be more than happy to accommodate other languages if anyone would like to submit translations. If you are familiar with the Android app structure and would like to simply email me an updated strings.xml and two-letter ISO language code, that's fine. Additionally, the project is available on <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/mtorch">Crowdin.com</a> for an easy web-based translation interface. Lastly, I also accept <a href="https://github.com/wKovacs64/mTorch/pulls">pull requests</a> on GitHub.</p>
